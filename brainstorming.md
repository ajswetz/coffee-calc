## Core Features:

- Calculate water required given dose of coffee, based on desired ratio
    EX: brew --coffee 35 --ratio 60
    EX: brew --coffee 35            # if ratio unspecified, uses default ratio of 60g/L

- Calculate coffee required given amount of water, based on desired ratio
    EX: brew --water 700 --ratio 60
    EX: brew --water 500            # if ratio unspecified, uses default ratio of 60g/L

- Convert between ratio formats grams-coffee/Liters-water and grams-water:grams-coffee

## Possible "bonus" features:

- Timer?
- Menu of recipes?
- Automated recipe walkthrough based on ratio and numbers?
    - E.G.: I choose to brew 30g coffee / 500g water; Brewing with V60; App shows a timer and beeps when it's time for the next action.
